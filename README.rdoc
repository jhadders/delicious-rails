= Delicious Rails: BDD/TDD Primer

In this 3-hour workshop weâ€™ll help you setup an automated test harness and introduce you to test-first methodologies as we attempt to build a simple Delicious.com clone together using Rails 3.1. Topics covered may include RVM, Ruby 1.9.2, Rails 3.1, Rspec, Capybara, Guard, and Spork as time allows. This will be a fun, hands-on/slides-free workshop in a relaxed atmosphere so please come prepared to hack, ask questions, and participate in discussions. Though we may not finish the application, you'll walk away with the knowledge of how to setup and get started testing Rails 3.1 along with running examples built in class.

== Prerequisites

A computer with RVM, Ruby 1.9.2, Rails 3.1, and your favorite text editor (*cough*vim*cough*). We expect that most attendees will have working knowledge or familiarity with Rails (any version) and feel comfortable installing gems and using the command line. While your machine's operating system isn't as important, we're familiar with Linux and OSX and as such will be of limited help troubleshooting Windows.
