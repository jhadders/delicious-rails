== 1. Why?
 - Increased confidence about quality and correctness of application code
 - Built-in documentation of the application code's intent
 - Ensures refactoring does not alter the code's contract
 - Forces you to slow down and do one thing at a time
== 2. How?
 - Write a spec, run it, see it fail
 - Write just enough code to make the spec pass
